# :coffee: :coffee: Baljans Balla Blipp :coffee: :coffee:

This is a small project for the _blipp_ system for coffee.

## Development

Can be run for example using the npm package `serve`.

```
npx serve web-root
```

Will then be reachable at `http://localhost:5000`. To run in a testing environment you can add the `testing` and `theme` URL parameters.

- `testing` removes the API call. Shows success or failure based on if any characters were typed before submission (Enter).
- `theme` takes the name of a theme and overrides any other theme that would be selected.

Example of an url with valid parameters `http://localhost:5000/?testing&theme=christmas`.
